# ParkSmart

Was a student-led capstone project by Chris, Justin, and Liza. The goal was to transform Humber College's parking system, enhancing its efficiency by turning the self-service stations into an mobile webapp and eliminating the need processes for using self-service at Humbers modern campus parking experience.

My goal is to learn the basics of React Native and build this application on mobile devices. To create real-world samples people can use on their phone.
